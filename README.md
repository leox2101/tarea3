# Task 3 – Program Verification

## Overview

In this task, we developed a piece of code that verifies whether the program is functioning correctly. The verification process focuses on checking the **preconditions** and **postconditions** required for the program to operate as expected.

Additionally, we provide a detailed explanation of the program logic and validate its correctness using formal verification rules.

## Tools and Environment

The following tools were used to carry out the verification:

- **Frama-C** version **24.0**
- **Alt-Ergo** version **2.4.1**
- **Why3** version **1.3.3**

These tools allowed us to analyze the program and ensure its compliance with the specified specifications.
