# Task 3 – Program Verification: Santiago Arellano -- Leandro Cardona Martinez --

## Overview

In this task, we developed a piece of code that verifies whether the program is functioning correctly. The verification process focuses on checking the **preconditions** and **postconditions** required for the program to operate as expected.

Additionally, we provide a detailed explanation of the program logic and validate its correctness using formal verification rules.

## Tools and Environment

The following tools were used to carry out the verification:

- **Frama-C** version **24.0**
- **Alt-Ergo** version **2.4.1**
- **Why3** version **1.3.3**
  
Operating Sistem
-**Windows11**
  
-**wsl ubuntu**

These tools allowed us to analyze the program and ensure its compliance with the specified specifications.


## Installation

# 1. Prepare opam installation
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install make m4 gcc opam

# 2. opam setup
opam init --disable-sandboxing --shell-setup
eval $(opam env)
opam install -y opam-depext

# 3. Install graphical dependencies
opam depext --install -y lablgtk3 lablgtk3-sourceview3

# 4. Install Frama-C
opam depext --install -y frama-c

# On WSL2, run the GUI as: GDK_BACKEND=x11 frama-c-gui
