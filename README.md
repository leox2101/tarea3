# Task 3

Hello, we basically created a piece of code that verifies whether the program is working correctly. With this code, we check the preconditions and postconditions necessary for the program to function properly.
We also provide an explanation of the program, where we verify its correctness using rules.

For the testing we used Frama C version 24.0,  alt-ergo 2.4.1, and why3 1.3.3.
